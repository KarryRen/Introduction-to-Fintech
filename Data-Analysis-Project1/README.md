## The Introduction of the Project

### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop **a machine learning-based model** that can predict **stock returns** based on **historical data and other relevant financial indicators**. The model should provide insights into future stock price movements, helping investors make informed decisions.

```
Input: Stock History Data and Indicators
Model: the Machine Learning-Based Model
Output: the Predict Stock Returns
```

### Grading and Submission

**At the group-level:** Focus on data collection and preprocessing, but have the model and prediction at the same time.

- **10% credits** will be granted based on the completion and degree of perfection.
- Submit the **program (code) used for data collection and preprocessing**.
- Submit a **short summary of data collection and preprocessing.**
- Submit any other thing that you are comfortable to share at the group-level.

**At the individual-level:** Focus on increasing the performance of model.

- **10% credits** will be granted based on the completion and machine learning performance.
- Submit the **program (code) used for individual analysis** (anything that your group did not share).
- Submit **a short summary** of (1) additional data sources that are not shared by the group(2) descriptions of feature selection (3) descriptions of model selection (4) report your model performance (5) economic interpretation on important features and its effects on stock return.

### Projuect Goals

- **Develop Predictive Models:** Create machine learning models to predict short-term and long-term stock returns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identify and select relevant features that impact stock returns, such as historical prices, trading volume, macroeconomic indicators, and company- specific factors.
- **Backtesting and Validation:** Implement rigorous backtesting to evaluate model performance over historical data and validate its accuracy on out-of-sample data.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model as an interactive tool or API for real-time predictions.



## Our steps in the Project

### Step 1. Data Collection

Which data should we collect ?

### Step 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing data, outliers, and anomalies.
- **Label Generating:** Generating the label.
- **Normalization/Standardization:** Apply appropriate scaling to ensure model performance.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create additional features such as lagged returns, volatility measures, and sentiment analysis from news data.

### Step 3. Model Development

**Model Selection:** Evaluate different machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- **Linear Models:** Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge
- **Tree-based Models:** Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
-  **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**Training:** Train models using historical data with a focus on minimizing overfitting and improving generalization.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to find optimal parameters.

### Step 4. Model Evaluation

**Performance Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-squared (R²)**
- **Corrlation (Corr)**
- **Sharpe Ratio ?**
