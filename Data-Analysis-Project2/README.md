## The Introduction of the Project

### Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a **natural language processing model** that can predict firm outcomes based on textual analysis. The model should be used to explore the explanatory power of new data on firm future performance, helping investors make informed decisions. Your analysis can involve but is not limited to machine learning, sentiment analysis, large language models. **Contrast to Project 1, this project will give you enough flexibility to explore. Thus, all works involving textual analysis using NLP models will be acceptable.**

**Example idea:**

Use text data in annual report (10-K) to predict firm stock return, stock volatility, ROA, leverage, cash, M&As, innovations, etc.

```
Input: Text
Model: NLP Model + Regression Model
Output: Return or other feature
```

The grading instructions and Project Goals are same as DAP1, never mind.



## Our steps in the Project

### Step 1. Data Collection

Which data should we collect ?

### Step 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing data, outliers, and anomalies.
- **Label Generating:** Generating the label.
- **Normalization/Standardization:** Apply appropriate scaling to ensure model performance.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create additional features such as lagged returns, volatility measures, and sentiment analysis from news data.

### Step 3. Model Development

Tokenize + Prediction

### Step 4. Model Evaluation
